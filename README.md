# LibHandler

This is a simple **WIP** C# LibGen Library that uses Web scraping and the "official" API to search and download books. <br>
Since this Library is still in early development I cannot guarantee a bug-free experience. <br>
Please note that if the LibGen API or Website changes at any point, this Library might break. <br>
The maintainers of the different LibGen Mirrors might limit your traffic or block you altogether if you misuse this Library. <br>
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** <br>

## Usage / Example

### Get IDs of the first 25 Books that have ".NET" in their title

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<string> ids = LibraryHandler.GetIDs(request);
```

### Get JSON Data of books with the provided IDs

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<string> ids = LibraryHandler.GetIDs(request);
string json = LibraryHandler.GetJSONData(ids);
// List<Book> books = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Book>>(json);
```

### Combined Version (This is the recommended way)

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<Book> books = LibraryHandler.GetBooks(request);
```

### Download Book
```cs
string download = LibraryHandler.GetDownloadLinkByMD5(books[0].md5);
// OR
string download = LibraryHandler.GetDownloadLink(books[0]);
```

### Additional Functions
```cs
// Gets the current Mirror (The Search and Download Mirror are seperate)
Mirror mirror = LibraryHandler.GetCurrentMirror(MirrorType.SearchMirror);
// Sets the current Mirror
Mirror mirror = new Mirror()
{
    Url = "libgen.is",
    FullUrl = "https://libgen.is",
    MirrorType = MirrorType.SearchMirror,
};

Mirror downloadMirror = new Mirror()
{
    Url = "library.lol",
    FullUrl = "http://library.lol",
    MirrorType = MirrorType.DownloadMirror,
    Path = "/main/"
};

LibraryHandler.SetCurrentMirror(mirror);
LibraryHandler.SetCurrentMirror(downloadMirror);
```
> Mirrors can also be added in the mirrors.json file
