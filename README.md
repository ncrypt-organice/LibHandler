# LibHandler

This is a simple **WIP** C# LibGen Library that uses Web scraping and the "official" API to search and download books. <br>
Since this Library is still in early development I cannot guarantee a bug-free experience. <br>
Please note that if the LibGen API or Website changes at any point, this Library might break. <br>
The maintainers of the different LibGen Mirrors might limit your traffic or block you altogether if you misuse this Library. <br>
**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** <br>

## Supported Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Books JSON | Get JSON Book Data of the provided IDs.  | 游릭 Works
| Multiple Mirrors | Use the optimal Mirror for searching and downloading. | 游리 Works, but there is only one download mirror and a handful of normal mirrors and the system is not very flexible
| Search (Title, Author, ...) | Search for books with certain filters | 游리 Works, but hasn't been tested with all filters yet
| Downloads | Download books | 游리 Works, but only with the MD5 Hash of the book and through library.lol

## Usage / Example

### Get IDs of the first 25 Books that have ".NET" in their title

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<string> ids = LibraryHandler.GetIDs(request);
```

### Get JSON Data of books with the provided IDs

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<string> ids = LibraryHandler.GetIDs(request);
string json = LibraryHandler.GetJSONData(ids);
// List<Book> books = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Book>>(json);
```

### Combined Version (This is the recommended way)

```cs
string request = LibraryHandler.GetRequestFormat(SearchField.Title, ".NET", 25);
List<Book> books = LibraryHandler.GetBooks(request);
```

### Download Book
```cs
string download = LibraryHandler.GetDownloadLinkByMD5(books[0].md5);
// OR
string download = LibraryHandler.GetDownloadLink(books[0]);
```

### Additional Functions
```cs
// Gets the current Mirror
Mirror mirror = LibraryHandler.GetCurrentMirror();
// Sets the current Mirror
Mirror mirror = new Mirror()
{
    Url = "libgen.is",
    FullUrl = "https://libgen.is",
    DownloadUrl = "http://library.lol/",
};

LibraryHandler.SetCurrentMirror(mirror);
